Candidate Feedback
==================

This is a space for you to give us feedback on the problem. This file
won't be initially seen by the people reviewing your solution: we just
want to make sure we can identify issues with the test.

In particular, we'd like to know roughly how long the test took you: we
**won't** be scoring on this, but we want to make sure we are pitching
the problem at the correct level.

If you had any issues, comments, or concerns with the problem, or if
you have any suggestions on how we might improve it, we'd be keen to
hear about those.
